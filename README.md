# AdventureWorks-Sales-Data-Analysis
A data analytics project using the AdventureWorks Sales data using Power BI

The data for this project was sourced from : https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/blob/main/AdventureWorks%20Sales%20Sample/AdventureWorks%20Sales.xlsx

This dataset contains the following data tables : 
  1. Customer
  2. Date
  3. Product
  4. Reseller
  5. Sales
  6. SalesOrder
  7. SalesTerritory

First, I explored the data in the tables given in the dataset. Here, I look for any missing or incorrect values that may be present in the raw data that needed to be transformed before I perform the data analysis. Since this is one of the most commonly used sample datasets that professionals use to learn PowerBI, I was not able to find any issues with this dataset. Next, I look at the tables in the model view of PowerBI to understand the relationship between the tables in the given dataset. Most relationships between the tables that are obvious at first glance are automatically recognized by PowerBI. Here, I needed to add some that were not obvious at first glance. Now, the data is ready for analysis.

This project aims to understand the sales data of the given organization. Here, I have divided the report into 4 sections : Sales Performance Report, Sales Analysis Report, Sales Trends and Forecast.

The Sales Performance Report gives a high level view of the sales data. Here, I look at the main KPIs and a high level analysis of the sales data. The Sales Analysis report further analysis the sales data, exploring the data from regional and product-wise perspective. I have also explored the average order value by country and time periods. The Sales Trends section explores the composition of products that made up the total sales reported and how the sales varied with different reseller business types. The Forcast section forecasts the expected sales in the future using the historical data.

In this project, I have explored the use of various types of visuals that can done in Power BI as listed below :
  1. Data Cards
  2. Line Charts(with legends, with forecasts, etc.)
  3. Waterfall Charts
  4. Clustered Bar Charts
  5. Maps
  6. Decomposition trees
  7. Ribbon Charts
