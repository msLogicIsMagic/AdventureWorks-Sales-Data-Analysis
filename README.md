# AdventureWorks-Sales-Data-Analysis
A data analytics project using the AdventureWorks Sales data using Power BI

The data for this project was sourced from : https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/blob/main/AdventureWorks%20Sales%20Sample/AdventureWorks%20Sales.xlsx

I have divided the report into 4 sections : Sales Performance Report, Sales Analysis Report, Sales Trends and Forecast.

The Sales Performance Report gives a high level view of the sales data. Here, I look at the main KPIs and a high level analysis of the sales data. The Sales Analysis report further analysis the sales data, exploring the data from regional and product-wise perspective. I have also explored the average order value by country and time periods. The Sales Trends section explores the composition of products that made up the total sales reported and how it has varied over time. The Forcast section forecasts the expected sales in the future using the historical data

In this project, I have incorporated various types of visuals that can done in Power BI :
  1. Data Cards
  2. Line Charts(with legends, with forecasts, etc.)
  3. Waterfall Charts
  4. Clustered Bar Charts
  5. Maps
  6. Decomposition trees
  7. Ribbon Charts
